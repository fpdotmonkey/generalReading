  abstract  = {Soft-continuum robots attract researchers owing to their advantages over rigid-bodied robots such as adaptation of the flexible structure to tortuous environments, and compliant contact mechanics. The need for new modeling methods to attain precise control for such systems has emerged from the recent rapid progress in soft robotics. This article presents a quasi-static model for a growing soft-continuum robot that is propelled via thin-walled inflated tubes, and steered by the difference between tube lengths. Therefore, the robot shaft is modeled as a series of inflated beams under deformation. A quasi-static model coupled with a kinematic model is developed to accurately position the end effector while accounting for the inflated beam stiffness and end-effector loads. The proposed model calculates control parameters, namely tube lengths and tendon tensions required to maintain the end effector at a certain position. Tip deflection due to end-effector loading is calculated and kinematic model inputs are updated to correct positioning error caused by shaft deformation. The model is simulated for the soft-continuum robot moving on a path to show the change in model parameters for vari- ous end-effector positions. Results demonstrate the significance of including pressurized tube stiffness in the model for growing robots of similar type. Second, the need for tendons in addition to pneumatic actuation is emphasized for accu- rate positioning of the end effector under loading. The proposed model offers a potential method for simulation and con- trol of similar growing soft-continuum robots presented in the literature.},
  comment   = {Developed a quasi-static model for a 3-tube vine robot.  Different from the one I came up with in that instead of inverting and everting the tubes, they pinch the tubes at the tip and pull the uninflated "tendons" back, and to bundle the tubes, they have a couple of sheaths, which allows for the tubes to torsion, which is necessary for reaching arbitrary points in 3D space.},

  abstract  = {A novel highly-extensible pneumatic actuator and the underlying drive principle is presented in this paper. First, a simplified physical model is proposed for the drive principle. Second, mechanical design and control system of the prototype are explained. Third, generated force and speed are investigated, and validity of the model is shown through experiments, both for one and two degree of freedom systems. Finally, a potential application of the actuator is demonstrated in the form of a soft robot that can achieve navigation in maze-like environments. Experimental results indicate that open-loop speed control of the actuator can be achieved with speeds higher than the ones found in literature. The extension ratio of the proposed actuator is only limited by length of the tubing used, and can be increased depending on the application field.},

  abstract  = {In robotics, high gear reductions are often required when using an electromagnetic motor to drive revolute joints, as in a humanoid robot. Strain wave gears (SWGs), also known as harmonic drives, are often used. However, these transmissions are relatively expensive and have a fixed gear ratio. Here, we present a low-cost transmission that maintains the high reduction of the SWG and enables a continuously variable gear ratio. We achieve this by, first, replacing the teeth of an SWG with a smooth frictional contact to enable continuous gear variation and, second, inverting the gear elements to enable high frictional torque transfer with a low preload via the capstan effect. We choose a gecko-inspired dry adhesive as the frictional material because it has high friction at low normal forces, and is not inherently tacky. We present a model describing the transmission, as well as experimental data gathered from a prototype device that verifies this model and establishes a proof of concept. Our transmission expands the possibilities for low-cost robotic systems.},

  abstract  = {Octopuses are molluscs that belong to the group Cephalopoda. They lack joints and rigid links, and as a result, their arms possess virtually limitless freedom of movement. These flexible appendages exhibit peculiar biomechanical features such as stiffness control, compliance, and high flexibility and dexterity. Studying the capabilities of the octopus arm is a complex task that presents a challenge for both biologists and roboticists, the latter of whom draw inspiration from the octopus in designing novel technologies within soft robotics. With this idea in mind, in this study, we used new, purposively developed methods of analysing the octopus arm in vivo to create new biologically inspired design concepts. Our measurements showed that the octopus arm can elongate by 70% in tandem with a 23% diameter reduction and exhibits an average pulling force of 40 N. The arm also exhibited a 20% mean shortening at a rate of 17.1 mm s−1 and a longitudinal stiffening rate as high as 2 N (mm s)−1. Using histology and ultrasounds, we investigated the functional morphology of the internal tissues, including the sinusoidal arrangement of the nerve cord and the local insertion points of the longitudinal and transverse muscle fibres. The resulting information was used to create novel design principles and specifications that can in turn be used in developing a new soft robotic arm.},

These capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate soft technolo- gies into their designs. The goal is to endow robots with new, bioinspired capabilities that permit adaptive, flexible interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review emerging soft-bodied robotic systems, and in particular recent developments inspired by soft- bodied animals. Incorporating soft technologies can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic com- plexity involved in robot design. Incorporating soft technologies will also expedite the evolution of robots that can safely interact with humans and natural envir- onments. Finally, soft robotics technology can be combined with tissue engineering to create hybrid systems for medical applications.},

  abstract  = {The octopus is a marine animal whose body has no rigid structures. It has eight arms composed of a pe- culiar muscular structure, named a muscular hydrostat. The octopus arms provide it with both locomotion and grasping capabilities, thanks to the fact that their stiffness can change over a wide range and can be controlled through combined contractions of the muscles. The muscular hydrostat can better be seen as a modifiable skeleton. Furthermore, the morphology the arms and the mechanical characteristics of their tis- sues are such that the interaction with the environment (i.e., water) is exploited to simplify control. Thanks to this effective mechanism of embodied intelligence, the octopus can control a very high number of degrees of freedom, with relatively limited computing resources. From these considerations, the octopus emerges as a good model for embodied intelligence and for soft robotics. The prototype of a robot arm has been built based on an artificial muscular hydrostat inspired to the muscular hydrostat of the Octopus vulgaris. The prototype presents the morphology of the biological model and the broad arrangement of longitudinal and transverse muscles. Actuation is obtained with cables (longitudinally) and with shape memory alloy springs (transversally). The robot arm combines contractions and it can show the basic movements of the octopus arm, like elongation, shortening and bending, in water.},

  abstract  = {Prosthetic hands, while having shown significant progress in affordability, typically suffer from limited repairability, specifically by the user themselves. Several modular hands have been proposed to address this, but these solutions require handling of intricate components or are unsuitable for prosthetic use due to the large volume and weight resulting from added mechanical complexity to achieve this modularity. In this letter, we propose a fully modular design for a prosthetic hand with finger and wrist level modularity, allowing the removal and attachment of tendon- driven fingers without the need for tools, retendoning, and rewiring. Our innovative design enables placement of the motors behind the hand for remote actuation of the tendons, which are contained solely within the fingers. Details of the novel coupling-transmission mechanisms enabling this are presented, and the capabilities of a prototype using a control-independent grasping benchmark are discussed. The modular detachment torque of the fingers is also computed to analyse the trade-off between intentional removal and the ability to withstand external loads. Experiment results demonstrate that the prosthetic hand is able to grasp a wide range of household and food items, of different shape, size, and weight, without resulting in the ejection of fingers, while allowing a user to remove them easily using a single hand.},

To address this challenging problem, we propose probabilistically-safe, online learning tech- niques to infer the altered dynamics of a robot at the moment a failure (e.g., physical damage) occurs. We combine model pre- dictive control and active learning within a chance-constrained optimization framework to safely and efficiently learn the new plant model of the robot. We leverage a neural network for function approximation in learning the latent dynamics of the robot under failure conditions. Our framework generalizes to various damage conditions while being computationally light-weight to advance real-time deployment. We empirically validate within a virtual en- vironment that we can regain control of a severely damaged aircraft in seconds and require only 0.1 seconds to find safe, information- rich trajectories, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.},

We present a meta- learning based policy gradient method for addressing the problem of adaptation in human-robot interaction and also investigate its role as a mechanism for trust modelling. By building an escape room scenario in mixed reality with a robot, we test our hypothesis that bi-directional trust can be influenced by different adaptation algorithms. We found that our proposed model increased the perceived trustworthiness of the robot and influenced the dynamics of gaining human’s trust. Additionally, participants evaluated that the robot perceived them as more trustworthy during the interactions with the meta-learning based adaptation compared to the previously studied statistical adaptation model.},
